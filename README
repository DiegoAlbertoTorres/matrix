This module makes a module for XScreensaver, which emulates the code of the
matrix as seen in the movie trilogy The Matrix.

Make generates a copy of the executable in a directory inside home, so that
~./xscreensaver can add it to its list of modules. A line has to be added
to this file so that XScreenSaver knows where to find the module.
